<p>Visually, this seems to fit my empirical data very well. If I'm happy with the fit, is there any reason that I should be doing something more complex, like using a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdispersion#Poisson\">negative binomial distribution, as described here</a>? (If so, any pointers or links on doing so would be much appreciated).</p>

<p>Oh, and I'm aware that this creates a slightly jagged distribution (due to the multiplication by three), but that shouldn't matter for my application.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  For the sake of anyone else who searches and finds this question, here's a simple R function to model an overdispersed poisson using a negative binomial distribution. Set d to the desired mean/variance ratio:</p>
